## Development Guidelines

### TDD Process
1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. Repeat for each feature

### Code Standards
- Follow Go best practices and idioms
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comprehensive comments for public APIs
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for CLI features
- Property-based tests for maze validation
- Benchmark tests for performance-critical code

### Git Workflow
- Create feature branches for each phase
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Ensure all tests pass before commits
- Use conventional commit format
